        <span>blargbot is free.</span>
        <p>
          I do not and will not charge money for any of blargbot's
          functionality. However, running it is most definitely not free. I put
          my own money into domains and web servers to keep the bot running.

          I don't like to beg, but right now I am a student attending
          university. Tuition is expensive, and money is tight. I don't expect
          to be paid for what I'm doing, but if you'd like to support me and
          help keep blargbot running, I have some donation options available.

          Thank you for all of your support. I really couldn't do this without
          you! <emoji content="❤" />
