        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Last updated: October 29, 2021</p>
        <p>
          Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. I am just a developer, and this is a
          hobby project. And as such, I cannot afford to hire a laywer. I'm
          writing this Privacy Policy to the best of my abilities. If there are
          any flaws, or things that need to be changed, please let me know!

          Privacy Policy. If you disagree, please remove blargbot and request
          that your data be deleted.

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>

        <p>We collect the following information about users:</p>
        <ul class="browser-default">
          <li>
            General information about users who have executed commands, such as:
            <ul class="browser-default">
              <li>their ID</li>
              <li>their username</li>
              <li>their discriminator</li>
              <li>their avatar URL</li>
              <li>their history of usernames</li>
              <li>
                other blargbot-specific information explicitly provided by the
                user
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            General information about guilds, such as:
            <ul class="browser-default">
              <li>guild id</li>
              <li>guild name</li>
              <li>other blargbot-specific configurations</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Chat logs (where applicable)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Usage of Information</h3>

        <p>
          General information is primarily used for caching purposes, to ease
          the burden on Discord's API. The exception to this is username
          history, which is used for historic username lookup as a moderation
          utility.
        </p>

        <p>
          blargbot-specific information and/or configurations are used to
          faciliate functionality within blargbot, such as the tag system.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chat logs are stored purely for moderation purposes, and are only
          collected when the guild has explicitly opted into the chat log
          system. It's expected that when guilds opt-in to chat logs, they
          convey this to users within the guild. Chat logs are used by users to
          pull up a list of messages sent in a guild, including message edits
          and deletions. Additionally, chat logs may be used by blargbot to
          supplement other logs with additional context (ex. message deletion
          logs).
        </p>

        <h3>Information Lifespan</h3>

        <p>
          General information and name history are stored forever, or until the
          lifespan of blargbot has been exceeded. It can be requested to be
          deleted at any point. See the Information Deletion section.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chat logs are stored for exactly 7 days from the time the message has
          been logged.
        </p>

        <h3>Information Deletion</h3>

        <p>To request that information is deleted, please either:</p>
