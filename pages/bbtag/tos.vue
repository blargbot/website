        <h2>BBTag Terms of Service</h2>
        <p>
          By creating public tags using the BBTag system, I acknowledge and
          agree to the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I will not create public tags containing Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content.
            <ol type="i">
              <li>
                NSFW content is defined by but not limited to the following
                criteria:
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>Being sexually explicit or suggestive</li>
                  <li>
                    Containing any other content that may be considered
                    unsuitable for the workplace, school, or any other public
                    setting
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                These criteria may be further defined by individual or specific
                review.
              </li>
              <li>
                NSFW content is allowed if the tag would execute an {nsfw} tag in all scenarios that NSFW content would be sent to discord.
                This will restrict the output to only be visible in channels marked as NSFW in discord.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            I will not create public tags containing illegal or unsafe content
            <ol type="i">
              <li>
                Illegal content is defined by but not limited to the following
                criteria:
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>Child pornography</li>
                  <li>
                    Copywritten material that is not your own IP (Intellectual
                    Property), including duplicates of existing tags
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Gore, scat, or other content that may cause others to feel
                    ill at ease
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                These criteria may be further defined by individual or specific
                review.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            I will not create public tags that attack, abuse, or offend
            individuals or minorities. This is defined by but not limited to the
            following:
            <ol type="i">
              <li>Personal insults or attacks</li>
              <li>Excessive racism or intolerance</li>
              <li>DOXXing</li>
              <li>Spamming (DM or otherwise)</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            I will not create public tags which claim to give rewards for
            favouriting.
            <ol>
              <li>
                I acknowledge that spreading misinformation about favouriting
                tags may get my favourite counter reset.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            I acknowledge that violating these terms will
            <ol type="i">
              <li>Cause my tag to be deleted</li>
              <li>Potentially cause me to be blacklisted from the system</li>
              <li>
                Force me to undergo any other sort of restriction or punishment.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
